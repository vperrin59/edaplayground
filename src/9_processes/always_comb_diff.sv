  // always_comb
  // When is it triggered ? does lhs retrigger sensitivity ?
  // always_comb automatically executes once at time zero, whereas always @* waits until a change occurs on a signal in the inferred sensitivity list.
  // always_comb is sensitive to changes within the contents of a function, whereas always @* is only sensitive to changes to the arguments of a function.
  // (However, it doesnâ€™t infer sensitivity from tasks. If a task takes zero time, you can use a void function instead to infer sensitivity.)
  // Variables on the left-hand side of assignments within an always_comb procedure, including variables from the contents of a called function,
  //  cannot be written to by any other processes, whereas always @* permits multiple processes to write to the same variable.
  //
  // It states that any expression that is written within the always_comb block or within any function called within the always_comb block is
  // excluded from the implicit sensitivity list

  // Those two always comb have different behaviours
